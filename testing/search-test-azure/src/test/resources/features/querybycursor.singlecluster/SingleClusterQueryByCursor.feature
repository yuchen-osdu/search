Feature: Search recursively on cursor with different queries
  To allow a user to find his data quickly, search should offer multiple ways to search data and iterate over all the results.

  Background:
    Given the schema is created with the following kind
      | kind                                           | schemaFile |
      | tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data--Integration:1.0.1    | records_1  |
      | tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data2--Integration:1.0.2    | records_2  |

  @default
  Scenario Outline: Ingest records for the given kind
    When I ingest records with the <recordFile> with <acl> for a given <kind>
    Examples:
      | kind                                          | recordFile  | acl                             |
      | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data--Integration:1.0.1" | "records_1" |  "data.default.viewers@tenant1" |
      | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data2--Integration:1.0.2"  | "records_2" | "data.default.viewers@tenant1"  |

  @default
  Scenario Outline: Search data in a given kind with returned fields
    When I send <query> with <kind>
    And I limit the count of returned results to <limit>
    And I set the fields I want in response as <returned_fields>
    And I send request to tenant <tenant>
    Then I should get in response <count> records containing <fields>

    Examples:
      | tenant    | kind                                                      | query         | limit | returned_fields   | count | fields              |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data--Integration:1.0.1"  | None          | None  | NULL              | 3     | acl,data.WellName   |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data2--Integration:1.0.2" | None          | None  | NULL              | 3     | id,data.Basin       |

  @default
  Scenario Outline: Search data in a given kind with excluded fields
    When I send <query> with <kind>
    And I limit the count of returned results to <limit>
    And I set the fields I want in response as <returned_fields> and <excluded_fields>
    And I send request to tenant <tenant>
    Then I should get in response <count> records not containing <fields>

    Examples:
      | tenant    | kind                                                      | query         | limit | returned_fields   | excluded_fields   | count | fields            |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data--Integration:1.0.1"  | None          | None  | NULL              | acl,data.WellName | 3     | acl,data.WellName |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:test-data2--Integration:1.0.2" | None          | None  | NULL              | id,data.Basin     | 3     | id,data.Basin     |

  @default
  Scenario Outline: Search recursively page by page data across the kinds
    When I send <query> with <kind>
    And I limit the count of returned results to <limit>
    And I set the fields I want in response as <returned_fields>
    And I send request to tenant <q1_tenant>
    Then I should get in response <first_count> records along with a cursor
    And I send request to tenant <q2_tenant>
    Then I should get in response <final_count> records

    Examples:
      | q1_tenant | q2_tenant | kind                                | query                     | limit | returned_fields | first_count | final_count |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:*:*" | None                      | 4     | All             | 4           | 2           |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:*:*" | None                      | None  | All             | 6           | 0           |
      | "tenant1" | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:*:*" | "TX OR TEXAS OR FRANCE"   | 1     | All             | 1           | 1           |

      | "tenant1" | "tenant1" | "tenant1:search<timestamp>:*:*" | "\"OFFICE2\" \| OFFICE3 \| OFFICE5" | 1     | All             | 1           | 1           |

    When I send <query> with <kind>
    And I limit the count of returned results to <limit>
    And I set an invalid cursor
    And I send request to tenant <tenant>
    Then I should get <response_code> response with reason: <reponse_type>, message: <response_message> and errors: <errors>
